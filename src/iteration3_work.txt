Fanghyi and I (Kent Sommer) did this together (jointly)

Although the pushes/commits are mostly in my name (Kent Sommer), we were working on lab machines
under my user account so most of the commits are under my name.

We each handled about 50% of both the parser.cpp changes and the AST.h classes. (Working "together" though). 

All other deliverables were done jointly.

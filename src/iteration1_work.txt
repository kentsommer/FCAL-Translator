Both Fangyi Zhu and myself (Kent Sommer) worked together on all parts of this iteration from concept 
to implmentation. Although the pushes/commits are mostly in my name, we were working on lab machines
under my user account so most of the commits are under my name.

Code writing ended up being about 50/50 but again we were working together so we helped each other on
almost all functions. Fangyi worked largely on the core regex creations for matching purposes. 
I (Kent Sommer) worked largely on the test writing as well as the non-regex related parts of the scan 
function.
